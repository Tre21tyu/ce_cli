What we aim to do is
- Combine writing notes with adding services
- Develop a time tracking system to keep track of when services start and end
- Develop a algorithmic process of adding those services to medimizer add services to work orders automatically
- Create dirs for each work order
├── wo
│   ├── pos
│   └── wo.md
Where wo is the work order number and pos are purchase orders for that WO number 
- Create POs from templates

The key point so far is the note taking system. It will make it so that I, as a technician can effectively *@ajust take notes* and rely on ce_cli to do the rest (unless I have to intervene)
